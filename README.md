# Football analyst Projext
## Introduction 
The goal of this project is to detect and track players, referees, and footballs in a video using YOLO, one of the best AI object detection models available. We will also train the model to improve its performance. Additionally, we will assign players to teams based on the colors of their t-shirts using Kmeans for pixel segmentation and clustering. With this information, we can measure a team's ball acquisition percentage in a match. 
## Modules used : 
The following modules are used in this project:
- YOLO: AI object detection model
- Kmeans: Pixel segmentation and clustering to detect t-shirt color
- Use interpolation methods to smooth ball detection
- Use the number of frames and the team in possession to determine the ball possession ratio.
